# Times Table Generator

This simple application was originally developed to allow my children to generate times table tests (called 80-80 tests).  It has since evolved a bit based on feedback from around the world.

The code isn't perfect but it is nice and simple with no requirement for a backend.

It is deployed in GitHub pages [here](https://john-gom.github.io/times-tables/).
